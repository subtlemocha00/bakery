				<h2>About Old Mill Bakery</h2>
				<p>
					Founded in the heart of Eldoria, a quaint medieval town known for its
					cobblestone streets and historical charm, Old Mill Bakery stands as a
					testament to the town's rich history. Established in 1420, the bakery
					was originally a mill that was transformed into a bakery by the Miller
					family, renowned for their artistry in bread making.

				<p>
					The bakery, nestled beside the gently flowing Eldor River, quickly
					became famous for its hearty, rustic breads and delicate pastries. The
					secret, as shared by the founding baker, Albert Miller, was in the
					unique blend of grains ground in the very mill that gave the bakery
					its name.

				<p>
					As Eldoria grew, so did the bakery's reputation. By the mid-15th
					century, Old Mill Bakery was not just a local favorite but had started
					attracting visitors from distant lands. Travelers often spoke of the
					bakery's enchanting aromas and the warm, welcoming glow of its hearth.

				<p>
					Today, Old Mill Bakery remains a family-run establishment, preserving
					the age-old baking techniques passed down through generations. The
					current owner, Eleanor Miller, great-granddaughter of Albert Miller,
					continues to bake using the same traditional recipes that have
					delighted patrons for centuries.

					The bakery not only serves as a culinary landmark in Eldoria but also
					as a gathering place for the community. It's a place where stories are
					shared, friendships are forged, and the simple joys of life are
					celebrated, one loaf of bread at a time.
